# Setup for Workshop
If you would like to follow along with us during the workshop, please set up the following:

### Create a Contentful account at [https://www.contentful.com/](https://www.contentful.com/). 
* For new accounts during the new user onboarding if you see an option for starter templates, choose 'Start from Scratch'. You do not have to complete the 'Learning Contentful' steps.
* If you already have a Contentful account and space, have at least one slot available for a new content type.

### For the code (frontend) of the project
* Download the latest version of Node. You need at least Node version 18.17.0.
